# Efficacy-of-various-ML-models-for-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-

* As the days of technology and its superiority are rpidly increasing for the good, the same can be said abt malintentions aswell. 

* Credit Card Fraud is becoming a widespread phenomena where the credit card details of a person is stolen and funds are misappropriated by the thief.

* This can have devastating effects on the victim whose information was stolen.

* Knowing this pain point I intended to stop the crime on the onset of any activity reminiscant of any fraudulent activities.

* I used the following sampling techniques to balance the dataset as it was very imbalanced.

* Then I applied the various models on the balanced dataset and imabalanced dataset. 

* Then I compared the efficacy of the various models in classifying fraudulent activites.

* In sampling, Oversampling techniques worked best and in modeling Random Forest and Neural Networks worked best.

Sampling Techniques I used:

  1) Random Undersampling
  2) Random Oversampling
  3) Adasyn
  4) SMOTE
  
Models that I used:

  1) Logistic Regression
  2) Random Forest Classifier
  3) Artificial Neural Networks
  4) AdaBoost
